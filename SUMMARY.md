**PCB Defect** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the manufacturing industry, and in the damage detection domain. 

The dataset consists of 1386 images with 2953 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *open_circuit*, *short*, *spurious_copper*, and other: *missing_hole*, *mouse_bite*, and *spur*.

Images in the PCB Defect dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 693 (50% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *ds* (693 images) and *rotation* (693 images). Also, the dataset includes ***subfolder*** and ***angle*** tags for *rotation* slit. The dataset was released in 2019 by the Peking University.
