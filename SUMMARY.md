**PCB Defect** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the manufacturing industry, and in the damage detection domain. 

The dataset consists of 693 images with 2953 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *open_circuit*, *short*, *spurious_copper*, and other: *missing_hole*, *mouse_bite*, and *spur*.

Images in the PCB Defect dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2019 by the Peking University and Shenzhen Skyworth-RGB Electronic, China.
